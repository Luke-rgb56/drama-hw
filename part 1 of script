Darren and Sharren standing outside Aaron’s house.

Sharren: (worried.) What am I going to do, Aaron can’t keep his temper with this sort of thing.

Darren: Don’t worry, if anything happens I’ll be out here.

Sharren: Alright, (turns and enters the house)

Aaron: happily Oh hello!

Sharren: Hey… I need to talk to you about something.

Aaron: ...okay?

Sharren: I’m having a kid

Aaron: This is great!

Sharren: But it isn’t yours

Aaron: (shouting) you what mate, I can’t believe it! (Raises fist as if to hit Sharren) you’re really done this time.

Sharren (ducks to avoid swinging fist) help!

Darren (storms inside)

Darren Get away from her!
